      <h1>Memo_er: flexible self-service data analysis</h1>

      <p>Memo_er is temporarily down while being revised and released as open source!</p>

      <p>Here's a short blurb on it:</p>

      <p>
        Memo_er is a self-service data analysis tool, an automated memo-writer.  Like a dashboarding system, it takes inputs from a user, runs an analysis written by a data scientist, and formats the results.  Unlike dashboarding systems, it allows the data scientist to write the analysis in Python, allowing more complex analyses to be automated, and presents results as memos, the standard output of data analysis, including explanations of the premises of the analysis and how to interpret the conclusions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Self-service data analysis tools allow Data Scientists to focus on their comparative advantage: <b>translating</b> a set of inputs or Premises and Data into a Conclusion, while allowing Product and other business units to decide exactly what the Premises of an analysis should be and how the Conclusions of an analysis should impact business decisions.  This <b>saves time</b>, produces <b>higher quality, reproducible</b> work output, and enables Data Scientists to <b>scale</b> their impact.
